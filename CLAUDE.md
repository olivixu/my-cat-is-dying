# Claude Code Session Notes

## Critical Issues Fixed (2025-09-16)

### 1. Scene 5 (Breathing Game) Auto-Skipping ✅
**Problem:** After completing Scene 4 (treat sorting), Scene 5 appears briefly but immediately skips to Scene 6 without allowing gameplay.

**Root Cause:** Scene 4's `completeGame()` was being called multiple times due to drag events on narrow viewports, causing race conditions.

**Fixed:**
1. **Scene 4 completion guard:**
   - Added `gameCompleted` flag to prevent multiple `completeGame()` calls
   - Prevents duplicate scene transitions

2. **SceneManager improvements:**
   - Added transition queue system to handle overlapping transitions
   - Implemented `isTransitioning` guard to prevent race conditions
   - Added proper timer management in base Scene class

### 2. Scene 6 (Pill Catching) - Cat Appearing Twice
**Problem:** The pixel smokey cat avatar appears at scene start, then moves in from bottom again, causing visual glitch.

**Fixed:**
- Added `opacity: 0` to `.scene-6-smokey` CSS class to hide cat initially
- Updated `slideUpSmokey` animation to fade in from opacity 0 to 1
- Cat now properly fades in as it slides up, preventing double appearance

### 3. Scene 7 (Matching Card Game) - Black Screen
**Problem:** Matching card game shows black screen, not loading properly.

**Fixed:**
- The `animationId` variable for TV static was scoped incorrectly (local to init function)
- Changed to store animation ID directly to `this.staticAnimationId` within the animation loop
- This ensures proper cleanup and prevents memory leak that was causing black screen

### 4. Navigation Broken ✅
**Problem:** Clicking navigation dots shows black screen instead of loading scenes.

**Root cause:** Scene transitions were breaking due to multiple issues:
- Scene 4 multiple completion calls
- SceneManager lacking transition guards

**Fixed:** 
- Added transition queue and guards in SceneManager
- Fixed Scene 4 completion logic
- Navigation now works reliably

### 5. Scene 5 to 6 Transition - Dot Jump and Black Flash ✅
**Problem:** 
1. Black flash between Scene 5 and Scene 6 despite both having sky backgrounds
2. Middle dot jumping left during expansion animation

**Fixed:**
1. **Black flash:** Removed 50ms delay in SceneManager, kept sky overlay during transition
2. **Dot jump:** Replaced complex dot expansion with overlay approach:
   - Creates separate blue circle overlay at middle dot position
   - Overlay expands while dots remain in flexbox (no layout shifts)
   - Reduced scale from 300 to 200 for better performance
