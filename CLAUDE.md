# Claude Code Session Notes

## Critical Issues Fixed (2025-09-16)

### 1. Scene 5 (Breathing Game) Auto-Skipping
**Problem:** After completing Scene 4 (treat sorting), Scene 5 appears briefly but immediately skips to Scene 6 without allowing gameplay.

**Fixed:**
1. **Added safeguards to prevent auto-completion:**
   - `hasInteracted` flag - tracks if user clicked
   - `hasMeaningfulInteraction` flag - tracks if user actually held during a bar
   - `minimumPlayTime = 5000` - requires 5 seconds before allowing completion
   - `gameStartTime` tracking
   - `isProcessingBreath` flag to prevent double-processing

2. **Fixed event listener mismatch (CRITICAL BUG):**
   - **Root cause:** Event listeners were added to `gameContainer` but removed from `this.element`
   - This caused memory leaks and accumulating event handlers
   - **Fix:** Store `this.gameContainer` as instance property in `setupEventListeners()`
   - Store bound event handler functions (`this.boundStartHolding`, etc.)
   - Remove listeners from same element (`this.gameContainer`) in cleanup

### 2. Scene 6 (Pill Catching) - Cat Appearing Twice
**Problem:** The pixel smokey cat avatar appears at scene start, then moves in from bottom again, causing visual glitch.

**Fixed:**
- Added `opacity: 0` to `.scene-6-smokey` CSS class to hide cat initially
- Updated `slideUpSmokey` animation to fade in from opacity 0 to 1
- Cat now properly fades in as it slides up, preventing double appearance

### 3. Scene 7 (Matching Card Game) - Black Screen
**Problem:** Matching card game shows black screen, not loading properly.

**Fixed:**
- The `animationId` variable for TV static was scoped incorrectly (local to init function)
- Changed to store animation ID directly to `this.staticAnimationId` within the animation loop
- This ensures proper cleanup and prevents memory leak that was causing black screen

### 4. Navigation Broken
**Problem:** Clicking navigation dots shows black screen instead of loading scenes.

**Root cause:** Event listener memory leaks and animation cleanup issues
- Scene 5: Event listeners weren't properly removed, they accumulated
- Scene 7: Animation frame IDs weren't stored correctly for cleanup

**Fixed:** 
- Scene 5: Event listener fix (see #1 above)
- Scene 7: Animation ID scoping fix (see #3 above)
- These fixes together should resolve navigation issues

## Code Locations

### Scene 5 (/Users/oliviaxu/my-cat-is-dying/js/scenes/scene5.js)
Key changes at lines:
- 135-163: `setupEventListeners()` - Store gameContainer and bound functions
- 684-690: `cleanup()` - Remove listeners from gameContainer using bound functions

### Scene 6 (/Users/oliviaxu/my-cat-is-dying/js/scenes/scene6.js)
Key change:
- Around line where fireworks complete - removed `this.cleanup()` before `onComplete()`

## Testing Checklist
After restart, verify:
- [ ] Scene 5 breathing game is playable (not auto-skipping)
- [ ] Scene 6 cat doesn't appear twice at start
- [ ] Scene 8 matching card game loads properly (no black screen)
- [ ] Navigation dots work without showing black screens
- [ ] No memory leaks from accumulating event listeners

## If Issues Persist
1. Check if event listeners are being added/removed from the same element
2. Verify SceneManager cleanup order
3. Check for any remaining `this.cleanup()` calls before `onComplete()`
4. Use browser DevTools to check for accumulated event listeners
5. Check console for any error messages during scene transitions
